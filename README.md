This web-application is full responsive, looking perfectly good on every type of device.
### 2.3 Design and Implementation Constraints
To make this web application, so far I have used HTML5, CSS4 and Javascript. With the help of HTML tags, later being stylized with the CSS functions that are used as a value for various CSS properties, we managed to bring ReSC project in this form. With the help of Javascript we managed to modify the content of certain elements (containers) so as to obtain the best visual effect (elements displayed or hidden, writting effects, changing images, etc). In order to have the best results, everything is full responsive; that was possible because we used measurement units related to the elements and viewport, and we also used <code>@media</code> queries.
### 2.4 User Classes and Characteristics
The content is mostly framed in container type elements, especially <code>div</code>. In order to stylize everything as aesthetically as possible, we used classes and ids to link the content in HTML with that in CSS, so that each container in HTML has a class assigned.
